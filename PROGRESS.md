# PROGRESS — Pokémon Crystal run

_Last updated: session of Aug 23 2026 (tooling round 2 + ZEPHYR BADGE)._

## Where we are

- Checkpoint to resume from: **`saves/zephyr-badge.state`** (frame 296052)
- Position: inside VIOLET_GYM at (5,2), Falkner beaten
- Party: CYNDAQUIL "AA" L14, 19/40 HP (heal before next fights)
- Money: ₽3764 · Badges: **ZEPHYR**
- Bag: no POTIONs, no balls

## Story progress

1. Started game, picked Cyndaquil ("AA"), rival named "AA"
2. Healed at Cherrygrove Pokecenter (`healed-1.state`)
3. Rival ambush crossed on Route 29 (`pre-rival.state`)
4. Mystery Egg received from Mr. Pokemon + Pokedex; egg DELIVERED to Elm
   (`egg-delivered.state`, frame 81004). Aide gave 5 Poké Balls?? — NOT
   verified in bag; `wNumBalls` reads 0 at default.state. If balls are
   missing when needed, re-check the aide scene trigger.
5. Currently retracing west along Route 29 (catch-tutorial cutscene fires
   around x=53 — may already be done).
6. **YOUNGSTER JOEY DEFEATED** (`joey.state`): beat his RATTATA L4 with
   CYNDAQUIL L9->L10. Prize +₽64 (3300 -> 3364).
7. **VIOLET CITY REACHED** (`violet-arrived.state`, frame 176067): walked
   Route 30 -> Route 31 -> gate -> Violet City, healed at Pokecenter
   (CYNDAQUIL L11 33/33). Several wilds won en route.
8. **ZEPHYR BADGE WON** (`zephyr-badge.state`, frame 296052): both Bird
   Keepers (Abe, Rod) beaten by the stalled p5 session, then Falkner
   finished off by this session's new `talk_to` primitive. Lost the first
   attempt at L13/17HP (whiteout), re-entered and won cleanly at L14.

## Route notes

- Route 29 west exit is at TOP-left (y=6-7); x=0-3 is wall at y>=8.
  goto(2,6) then walk L*3.
- Cherrygrove north exit: goto(16,0), walk U*3 -> Route 30 south end (6,53).
- Trainer sight-lines do NOT auto-trigger via BFS pathing reliably; talk to
  trainers directly (stand adjacent, face them, A, flush_dialog, then POLL
  up to ~2000 frames for wBattleMode before giving up — the transition is
  slow).
- The Route 31->Violet gate is finicky: from Route 31 side stand on the
  door cells (4,6)/(4,7), walk L to enter (warp fires sideways, not from a
  standing start). Inside, goto(0,4) then walk L*3 into Violet City.
- Violet Pokecenter door: goto(31,25), walk U*2.

## Next objective

Heal at the Violet Pokecenter, buy/catch supplies (no balls or potions
left), then Route 32 south toward UNION CAVE / AZALEA. Or grind Route 31/
Violet outskirts for a 2nd party member (ball throws now verified working).
Suggested checkpoints: `route32.state`, then `hive-badge.state` later.

## Active sessions

| session | owns | working state |
|---------|------|---------------|
| tower agent | Sprout Tower -> Elder Li | `joey.state` (frame 238979, SPROUT_TOWER_2F) |
| ox-alpha (p9) | done this round: tooling round 2 + ZEPHYR BADGE (`zephyr-badge.state`) | — |

Rule: never write another session's working state or a milestone checkpoint;
promote progress under NEW filenames. See AGENTS.md "Multiple agents".

## Harness state (as of tooling round 2)

- Round 1 audit fixes (catch(), grind early-exit, CLI validation, banked-WRAM
  reads) — see commit history.
- **Round 2 additions (all live-tested on disposable forks):**
  - `Driver.talk_to(x,y)` + `trek talk X Y`: walks adjacent (or across a
    counter — nurse case) to any NPC, faces them, talks; fights trainer
    battles that trigger and polls the slow sight-line transition. Verified
    vs nurse (plain dialog) AND Falkner (badge fight won).
  - `Driver.settle()`: door/cutscene warps finish asynchronously AFTER the
    step that triggered them — walk/goto/talk now settle before reading the
    map. This race cost p5 its gym attempt ("in: VIOLET_CITY" while actually
    inside the gym).
  - `goto` no longer deadlocks on NPCs: distinguishes "statically blocked"
    (gives up immediately with `no static path`) from "NPC in the way"
    (threads through NPC cells; step_dir handles bumps).
  - `emu.write(addr|sym, data)` for test setup; banked-WRAM guarded like
    read.
  - Item lookup normalized: repo names item 5 `"# BALL"` (POKé glyph);
    callers say `"POKE BALL"` — both work now. This bug made ball lookups
    impossible before.
  - Verified with real inventory: mid-battle `switch_to` (won a wild after
    switching) and real ball throw via `catch()` (`[caught]` on POLIWAG).
  - Gotcha learned: RAM-injected party members MUST also get nickname+OT
    bytes written (`wPartyMonNicknames`/`wPartyMonOTs`, 11B slots) or the
    text engine hard-freezes on "Go! ?????".

## Gotchas discovered this run

(See AGENTS.md for the full list; newest here.)
- Battle menu cursor is `wMenuCursorY/X`, not `wMenuCursorPosition`
  (that one only writes on confirm) — cost a full debugging session.
- Move-selection menu has no literal "PP" text; detect it by ▶+move-name.
- Door/cutscene warps complete asynchronously AFTER the triggering step;
  always `settle()` before trusting map/pos (new gotcha #12 in AGENTS.md).
- RAM-injected party mons need nickname+OT bytes or text freezes on
  "Go!" — test-setup-only hazard.
